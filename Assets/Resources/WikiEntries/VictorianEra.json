            "entryBody": "Period in the United Kingdom history that began and ended similarly to but not exactly like Queen Victoria’s regency: from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901, while the era itself is estimated to take place somewhen between 1820 to 1914. Those 94 years bear significance due to the rapid development of technology, both industrial and domestic, and a social turn to modesty and devotion, with an emphasis on christianity: the values, the church services and activities around it. The era was full of turmoil: rapid urbanisation would lead to growth of population never seen before, multiple different plagues would ravage lower classes of society, new political and social groups and ideologies would emerge and fight the old ones, etc. The Victorians may be romanticised or ridiculed, but they really did bring about a lot of changes into the modern world.
