		   "storyText": "You can feel people's stares at you during and after the ceremony. Some even whisper behind your back as you walk pass them. As you walk up to your parents, you can see your Mother's embarrassed and furious face. Even your Father seems disappointed and angry with you. They are one of very few parents who stand alone and the more you think about it, the more it becomes obvious to you that, unlike others, they are not alone by their own choice.\nYou don't spend much time there after the official, mandatory part and leave immediately when it's not impolite. On your way back home no word is spoken. Situation doesn't change in the following morning when you join your family for breakfast. When you go back to your room after finishing the meal, you find two maids packing your clothes and other personal belongings. They say they're doing what your parents ordered so you run over to Father's study to confront them about it.\nFather remains silent even when you begin to yell but Mother breaks eventually. 'You have brought it upon yourself, you insolent child!' she hisses under her breath. You find yourself lost for words and confused with the whole situation. Mother continues her crochet and Father keeps reading. Seconds pass accompanied with ticking of the clock.\n'Why and where?' you ask with weak voice. You tremble with nerves.\n\n\nCongratulations! You have obtained an 'Overseas Ending.'"
